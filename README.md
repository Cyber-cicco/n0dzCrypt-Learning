# N0dzCrypt-Learning 

## What is this project about ?

This project was supposed to be the LMS of Diginamic, a school specialized in web developpement that I developped during spare time I had between other official developpement projects and lessons I had to deliver to students.

But since we didn't have the needed infrastructure and funds to developp and maintain our own LMS, the direction decided to use Moodle instead and gave me the permission to make this repository public on my own profile.

As for it's use, it will be the main source of components I will use to develop Free-Learning, an Open-Source LMS that aims to be the wikipedia of online courses.

But most importantly, it will act as a demonstration of the uses of N0dzCrypt, a fullstack metaframework for the Java Scripting language, and how it can be used to get components from any N0dzCrypt public repository on github.

## How can I install it ?

Create a user digi-suivi identified by 'pazo1928!', and grant him all privileges on the database

Then, run the app.
